/**
 * @mainpage
 *
 * spvm_utf8proc is a free/open-source (MIT/expat licensed) C library
 * providing Encode normalization, case-folding, and other operations
 * for strings in the UTF-8 encoding, supporting Encode version
 * 9.0.0.  See the spvm_utf8proc home page (http://julialang.org/spvm_utf8proc/)
 * for downloads and other information, or the source code on github
 * (https://github.com/JuliaLang/spvm_utf8proc).
 *
 * For the spvm_utf8proc API documentation, see: @ref spvm_utf8proc.h
 *
 * The features of spvm_utf8proc include:
 *
 * - Transformation of strings (@ref spvm_utf8proc_map) to:
 *    - decompose (@ref SPVM_UTF8PROC_DECOMPOSE) or compose (@ref SPVM_UTF8PROC_COMPOSE) Encode combining characters (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combining_character)
 *    - canonicalize Encode compatibility characters (@ref SPVM_UTF8PROC_COMPAT)
 *    - strip "ignorable" (@ref SPVM_UTF8PROC_IGNORE) characters, control characters (@ref SPVM_UTF8PROC_STRIPCC), or combining characters such as accents (@ref SPVM_UTF8PROC_STRIPMARK)
 *    - case-folding (@ref SPVM_UTF8PROC_CASEFOLD)
 * - Encode normalization: @ref spvm_utf8proc_NFD, @ref spvm_utf8proc_NFC, @ref spvm_utf8proc_NFKD, @ref spvm_utf8proc_NFKC
 * - Detecting grapheme boundaries (@ref spvm_utf8proc_grapheme_break and @ref SPVM_UTF8PROC_CHARBOUND)
 * - Character-width computation: @ref spvm_utf8proc_charwidth
 * - Classification of characters by Encode category: @ref spvm_utf8proc_category and @ref spvm_utf8proc_category_string
 * - Encode (@ref spvm_utf8proc_encode_char) and decode (@ref spvm_utf8proc_iterate) Encode codepoints to/from UTF-8.
